### Before starting the design review

Before starting the design review, it is important to address the following points in the action development review:

-   [ ] Are there any existing tool/service specifications or user guides available? Is all the information provided clear and sufficient for the development process?

-   [ ] Is there a domain expert accessible? Which team do they belong to and who is the designated expert?

-   [ ] Is the user scenario clearly defined? Which team does it come from and who is responsible for providing the scenario details?

### When designing a workflow

When designing a workflow, it is essential to ensure the fulfillment of the following requirements before proceeding with subsequent steps:

-   [ ] What are the essential dependencies? This includes files, processes, frameworks, and other necessary components.

-   [ ] Is the domain time-critical? If so, what precautions should be taken to avoid potential issues or delays?

-   [ ] Is the domain performance-critical? If so, what measures should be taken to optimize performance and avoid any potential bottlenecks?

-   [ ] Is the domain network-critical? If so, what steps should be taken to ensure reliable network connectivity and avoid any disruptions?

-   [ ] Are there any unaddressed exceptions that during the spike phase? These exceptions should be identified and well-listed before proceeding further.
